                <article>
                    <p>Hi.I am a Genshin player and I'd Like to give my feedback on my life in genshin to you all.
                        My Experience when playing Genshin has been great. I have been playing for around 2 yrs now. I created an new account After I realised the bad mistake I made in previous one(Focusing on Adventure rank instead of focsing on the characters themselves.)
                        I'm currently at adventure rank 42 and I did that within 5 months. It has been an amazing experience considering I have been using 4 star characters. Also, I consider this as an opportunity to not only teach others but also to reflect on oneself and improve on the areas necessary.  
                    </p>
                    <p>This guide is a form of telling others how I am a strong character in genshin and which characters I use for my gameplay. I'll give a briefing on the characters explaining how I use them and other things such as talents, artifacts and weapons as well.</p>
                    <p>The characters I use are eight and you can see them from the left side of your page. There are additional more(Those that I wish for in the coming future and how I would build them.)
                        So without much of wasting your time let me get into it.
                    </p>
                </article>

            <section class="main-section" id="Yanfei">
                <header><h3>Yanfei</h3></header>
                <article>
                    <img class="Characters" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gensin-impact/images/f/fc/Yanfei_Card.png/revision/latest?cb=20210422100113" alt="Yanfei" />
                    <p >Yanfei is a 4 star character who is from Liyue. She is an adepti. Although she has not signed a contract with Rex Lapis, she devotes herself as a legal advisor to Liyue. She has a pyro vision and she is a mage. Her birthday is on July 28th.</p>
                    <p >
                        Since she is a mage,she does well in good catalyst. I use her as my main DPS and for that I would best equip her with <code> <a href="https://static1.thegamerimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tome-of-the-eternal-flow-catalyst-in-genshin-impact.jpg?q=70&fit=crop&w=740&dpr=1">Tome Of The Eternal Flow</a></code>
                        If you're lucky enough to have Neuvillette's weapon in Genshin Impact, it can be well-suited for Yanfei since it already provides a massive 88.1 percent Crit DMG boost after being upgraded, which already takes away a lot of pressure from your artifact farming.

                        Apart from that, this weapon can increase her Charged Attack DMG by up to 42 percent while also regenerating some Energy when you have full stacks of this Charged Attack DMG boost. Both of these effects work great with Yanfei since she needs her Burst to perform Charged Attacks faster. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This part is about artifacts. One of the best artifacts for Yanfei is the Crimson Witch of Flames Artifact Set.

                    <p >Mona is a 5 star character who excess in hydro application. She is from Monstadt and can astologer. Her vision if hydro. Her birthday is August 31st.
                        At first, I wasn't happy that I got her since I lost my 50/50 from Neuvillette. Later I came to realise how good she is in the game especially if its crowd control(Neuvillete doesn't have this feature but he does not need it as he is strong.)</p>
                    <p >Mona is also a catalyst.
                        When it comes to weapons, The Widsith is a good weapon. As a 4 star, it has crazy stats. Mona's stats are increased and that makes as good as a main DPS. Especially when it comes to crowd control.</p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to Artifacts, the Noblesse Oblige Set is a great option.
